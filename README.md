# JavaWaveGame

Created a java wave-based game through JFrame and Canvas. The purpose of the game is to make contact with the boss enemy (depleting its health) before 
you lose all your health. Character movement is continuous meaning once you start moving you can't stop, but the player can use a manual input to halt their
character’s movement. Each time the boss’s health reaches 0, a new and more powerful boss will spawn.

The game uses simple keyboard controls for movement(A W S D E F). The E button implemented as a stop mechanic to halt ur characters movements and the F button 
activates each character’s unique skill, which will help them defeat the boss character.
